  aboutMe: {
    text: `I am a full-stack developer with over 12 years of experience building dynamic, secure, and scalable web applications. My expertise spans from crafting responsive, intuitive user interfaces to developing robust back-end systems. Iâ€™m proficient in frameworks like React, Next.js, Express, and Nest.js, which allow me to deliver high-quality applications for both web and mobile platforms.

On the front-end, I focus on creating fast, accessible, and engaging user experiences, implementing responsive designs that work seamlessly across devices. Using tools like React and Next.js, I ensure efficient performance through strategies like lazy loading and code splitting.

On the back-end, I design secure architectures using frameworks such as Express and Nest.js. I prioritize security, scalability, and clean code in everything I build, whether it's a simple REST API or a complex, data-driven system. I also have experience with both SQL and NoSQL databases, ensuring secure and optimized data management.

Collaboration is key for me, and I enjoy working with teams to bring ideas to life, whether it's for startups or enterprise projects. My goal is always to deliver high-quality, user-centric solutions that meet business objectives.`,
